    <!-- starts paragraph -->
    <p id="p1">I am taking this class so I am able to prepare myself to be able to work on <strong>tech</strong>. I want to be able to work on making many sites. I want to be able to make sites because at a certain point in time I want to have a site to be able to put all my info needed there. Another thing I took this class for was coding. I want to learn coding so in the future I can look at different types of code to figure out how other sites work.</p>

    <h2>What am I hoping to do by end of class</h2>
    <!-- starts paragraph -->
    <p>By the end of this class I want to be able to make <em> meaningful </em> sites and learn a lot more about coding. I would like to be able to have these two things be second nature to me so I am able to get farther and have a head start in technological type jobs. Another thing I hope to be able to be able to do by the end of this class is be able to put together a pc from scratch. I want to do this so I can get a good pointer so I can understand why a part goes where it needs to be. This can also help me when I want to build a personal pc to what I need and want. </p>
